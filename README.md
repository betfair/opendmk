Betfair OpenDMK
===============

Given the lack of an opendmk binary in a central repo, this work builds upon that of [nickman](https://github.com/nickman/OpenDMK) to provide such a binary, albeit under a different groupId, such that it doesn't clash should the main project one day publish their own artifact.

Currently this project has only published SNAPSHOT builds to the [OSS Sonatype repo](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/betfair/net/java/opendmk/).

The original code is released under and governed by either the GNU General Public License, Version 2 only (GPL) or the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL), and so this project chooses to run under the same [dual license](https://opendmk.java.net/legal_notices/licenses.txt).
