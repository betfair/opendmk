Betfair OpenDMK
===============

Given the lack of an opendmk binary in a central repo, this work builds upon that of [nickman](https://github.com/nickman/OpenDMK) to provide such a binary, albeit under a different groupId, such that it doesn't clash should the main project one day publish their own artifact.

The original code is released under and governed by either the GNU General Public License, Version 2 only (GPL) or the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL), and so this project chooses to run under the same [dual license](https://opendmk.java.net/legal_notices/licenses.txt).
